      <description>A few days ago, a poor GPU rig, aka Ring0 (long story, don&amp;rsquo;t ask), was full of sticky dust and (probably) dry thermal paste, so I decided that something had to be done; at the end of the day, Ring0 never did anything wrong to deserve that. Keeping in mind my decision, I started to tear down Ring0 aiming for a deep cleaning; fortunately Dennis was there to help making the whole process way quicker.</description>

      <description>With this short post I want to put together a few very good tips I found on the internet about how to prepare for and how to survive the OSCP exam. This is not a tool-kit since you will just need a basic Kali installation for your OSCP exam.
 Preparing for the exam Since the OSCP certification is relatively expensive, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re still a student. However, there are simple ways to start preparing even before enrolling in order to save at least a month of paid lab.</description>
